# Comfortable Basic

Comfortable Basic is a modern, simple Hugo theme. Intended for a blog like website with posts.

## Project is WIP

This is not a fully working release. At the moment the theme can only deal with a limited blog style with posts and a link to a permalinked post.

### TODO

- Ability to deal with code blocks
- Add some tag/categorisation handling to posts
- Ability to click through on categories
- Pages support
- Logo support
- Optional site intro
- Create example site with dummy content
